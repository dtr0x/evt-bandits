## Risk-Averse Action Selection Using Extreme Value Theory Estimates of the CVaR

https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01718

This code will generate all data used in simulations presented in the paper and produce plots. Parameters can be adjusted to produce results for other scenarios.

### Requirements:
* Python v3.xx
* Modules:
  * numpy
  * scipy
  * matplotlib
  * multiprocessing

  ## Replicating results
  Executing **gen_data.py** and **light_tailed.py** will generate all samples from all distributions given in the paper, and compute estimated CVaRs (alpha=0.998) using CVaR-SA and CVaR-EVT. All samples and CVaR values will be stored in the **data** folder. Bandit experiment data must be generated in a similar fashion by running **cvar_sr_bandit.py** and **light_tailed_bandit.py**. The various plotting scripts will output results stored in the **plots** folder. Since generating all samples and estimated quantities is quite memory-intensive (requiring the multiprocessing module), all calculated values are already provided in the data folder, but samples must be re-generated by the user due to size constraints.
